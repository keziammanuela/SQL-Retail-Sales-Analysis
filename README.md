# Water Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL

## Overview
This project showcases end-to-end data analysis on a retail sales dataset 
using MySQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from transactional 
data by applying SQL queries, aggregations, and window functions.

By creating and using a structured water retail sales database (including Customer, SalesPerson, Orders, Product, and OrderItem tables), this project covers the following aspects:
### Objectives
- Aggregate monthly and yearly sales data
- Analyze product performance across categories and time
- Identify sales trends and compute year-over-year growth
- Segment salespersons by performance
- Segment customer based on purchasing behavior
- Calculate category contribution to total sales

## Dataset
This project uses data from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/haonguyen9802/Analysing-H-Sport-Retail-Data-Using-SQL/tree/main), with some changes applied to facilitate deeper analysis.
